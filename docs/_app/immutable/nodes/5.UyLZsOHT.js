Fineeee *Insert eye roll* You wanna know about all of them or just the one on my nose??  
                    <br/> All of them?! Are you crazy I litterally just told you I have to many to even count. I will tell you about the one on my nose. Hmph, *crossing arms and shighing* 
                    <br/> I fought against a super strong bird. A falcon bird human or something. She had very big claws and used feathers as swords. If a little blue birdy hadn&#39;t interfered I would have won.
                    <br/> Or rather if my brother, Arathorn and the blue birdy had not interfered she would have been dead. *Evil laugh* But anyway, she took that feather of hers and sliced it across my poor nose. 
                    <br/> Not that it matters, my skin is already coverd in scars.
                    <br/> Next question. <b>You heard that Arathorn had a moose and you want to know how mine look and what name it has?</b> Alrighty. I gave my moose the name Chayveon. I don&#39;t know what it means though. Her fur is silver and white.
                    <br/> She lights up in the moonlight, which looks cool and all, but it&#39;s not very effective when we want to blend in with the shadow.
