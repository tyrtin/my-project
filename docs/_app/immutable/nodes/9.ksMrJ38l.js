He was young but albeit very experienced.
                        <br/>I knew I had the disadvantage. But my subordinates were all afraid of him. So I had to be the one to fight him.
                        <br/>I did it for Theodluin, my adoptive son. I can still hear his screams eco in my ears when one of them shot him in the eye. 
                        <br/>He surrvived but barly. I remember attacking Arathorn in a misserble attempet to distract him. Then I ran and scooped a crying Theodluin in my arms.
                        <br/>But Arathorn had caught up to me and he wasted not even a second to strike. His sword stiked me over my cheek and throat. There you have it, how I got my scar. One of many. But I do not want to talk about the rest.
                        <br/><b>You want the story of Theodluin?</b> That is not my story to tell. You will have to ask him, although I am not sure he wants to talk about it.
                        <br/>I can say this much. I took him to Aithlin since we cooperated when the warriors attacked our territories.</li></ul>`,i,s,c,f,w;function v(r,n){return r[0]==="f.png"?B:D}let p=v(o),l=p(o);return{c(){e=m("main"),t=m("fieldset"),t.innerHTML=a,i=N(),s=m("div"),c=m("img"),w=N(),l.c(),this.h()},l(r){e=u(r,"MAIN",{class:!0});var n=g(e);t=u(n,"FIELDSET",{class:!0,"data-svelte-h":!0}),z(t)!=="svelte-2xwn7b"&&(t.innerHTML=a),i=M(n),s=u(n,"DIV",{class:!0});var k=g(s);c=u(k,"IMG",{src:!0,alt:!0}),k.forEach(d),w=M(n),l.l(n),n.forEach(d),this.h()},h(){h(t,"class","svelte-1tid0dh"),_(c.src,f=o[0])||h(c,"src",f),h(c,"alt","Filvendore"),h(s,"class","svelte-1tid0dh"),h(e,"class","svelte-1tid0dh")},m(r,n){y(r,e,n),b(e,t),b(e,i),b(e,s),b(s,c),b(e,w),l.m(e,null)},p(r,[n]){n&1&&!_(c.src,f=r[0])&&h(c,"src",f),p===(p=v(r))&&l?l.p(r,n):(l.d(1),l=p(r),l&&(l.c(),l.m(e,null)))},i:I,o:I,d(r){r&&d(e),l.d()}}}let Y="https://images-wixmp-ed30a86b8c4ca887773594c2.wixmp.com/f/6c3d567d-af2b-469e-b10c-d5b135964ab2/dg06u31-77d706fb-6721-4a63-9fa3-a41bd55079d2.png?token=eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJzdWIiOiJ1cm46YXBwOjdlMGQxODg5ODIyNjQzNzNhNWYwZDQxNWVhMGQyNmUwIiwiaXNzIjoidXJuOmFwcDo3ZTBkMTg4OTgyMjY0MzczYTVmMGQ0MTVlYTBkMjZlMCIsIm9iaiI6W1t7InBhdGgiOiJcL2ZcLzZjM2Q1NjdkLWFmMmItNDY5ZS1iMTBjLWQ1YjEzNTk2NGFiMlwvZGcwNnUzMS03N2Q3MDZmYi02NzIxLTRhNjMtOWZhMy1hNDFiZDU1MDc5ZDIucG5nIn1dXSwiYXVkIjpbInVybjpzZXJ2aWNlOmZpbGUuZG93bmxvYWQiXX0.EXnghx51urbcBm27EHJRC3axl7pbHfeIBFiepzjWphQ";function J(o,e,t){let a="f.png";function i(){t(0,a=Y)}function s(){t(0,a="f.png")}return[a,i,s]}class E extends j{constructor(e){super(),Z(this,e,J,G,O,{})}}export{E as component};
