                    <li><b>Details: How I got my scar?</b> I was fighting Arathorn. He was young but albeit very experienced.
                        <br>I knew I had the disadvantage. But my subordinates were all afraid of him. So I had to be the one to fight him.
                        <br>I did it for Theodluin, my adoptive son. I can still hear his scearms eco in my ears when one of them shot him in the eye. 
                        <br>He surrvived but barly. I remember attacking Arathorn in a misserble attempet to distract him. Then I ran and scooped a crying Theodluin in my arms.
                        <br>But Arathorn had caught up to me and he wasted not even a second to strike. His sword stiked me over my cheek and throat. There you have it, how I got my scar. One of many. But I do not want to talk about the rest.
                        <br><b>You want the story of Theodluin?</b> That is not my story to tell. You will have to ask him, although I am not sure he wants to talk about it.
                        <br>I can say this much. I took him to Aithlin since we cooperated when the warriors attacked our territories.
                        <br><b>If we have any special animals...</b> Hmm, ah yes we usualy ride </li>
